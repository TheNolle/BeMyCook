## About the App
Be My Cook is a web app that generates personalized recipe recommendations based on the user's available ingredients and current mood. When the user enters their ingredients and mood, the app uses machine learning to analyze the input and generate recipe recommendations. The app also allows users to create an account, save their favorite recipes, and access their recipe history.

### User Authentication
Be My Cook uses a simple, single-user login system to authenticate users. When the user creates an account, their email and password are stored securely in the database using bcrypt encryption. The app also uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate users and ensure that only authorized users can access their saved recipes and preferences.

### Responsive Design
Be My Cook is designed to work well on desktop and mobile devices. The app uses responsive design techniques to adjust the layout and styling based on the user's device and screen size. The app also uses media queries and flexible units (such as percentages and ems) to ensure that the app is accessible and user-friendly on a wide range of devices.

### Data Storage
Be My Cook uses MongoDB to store user data, including recipes, preferences, and account information. The app uses Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, to interact with the database. The database is hosted on a cloud-based server for fast and reliable access.
